<p align="center"> I am a Grade 9 student this S.Y 2023 - 2024. My favorite subject is Math. I hate Filipino and A.P. because it's in Tagalog. When I started existing, I was already so bad in understanding and speaking Tagalog. I got this very hard accent that it sounded like I was angry when I'm actually speaking my native language. I also know how to speak english because when I was a kid, I used to always watch cartoons that are in English. I actually joined a math competition for two times (not flexing).I could say I'm not the most stupid nor smartest. I'm just an average honor student. The one thing I hate about myself as a student is that I have very ugly handwriting.
