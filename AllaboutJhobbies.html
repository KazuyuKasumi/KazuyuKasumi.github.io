I really love drawing ever since I was little and got more time in the pandemic to draw.
I was inspired by seeing art of artists with different art styles
(anime, realism, and semirealism ) like Shinigami arts, Kelsey Beckett, Margaret Morales,
Drawholic, tppo, kuroshiro, Alma Luna and more. Another part of my inspiration in making art is watching anime, playing video games and kpop
I use color pencils, watercolor, alcohol markers, and digital tablet with stylus pen. I started making art during 2016/2017
